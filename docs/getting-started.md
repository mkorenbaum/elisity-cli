# Getting Started with the Elisity CCC CLI

The Elisity CCC CLI is a command-line interface to the Elisity Cloud Control Center API. It provides 441 commands across 10 command groups covering topology, policy, devices, connectors, AD/Entra integration, traffic flows, insights, and system operations.

This guide walks you through installation, configuration, authentication, and your first commands.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9 or later** (`python3 --version` to check)
- **Network access** to your Elisity CCC instance (e.g., `https://your-ccc.idp01.elisity.io`)
- **API credentials** — an OAuth2 client ID and client secret with appropriate scopes, obtained from your CCC administrator

> **Which branch?** These docs are the `compat/python-3.9` branch — same CLI source as
> `main`, with dependency pins held at the newest releases that still support Python 3.9.
> **Use it only where Python 3.9 is mandatory.** Otherwise use `main` (Python 3.10+), which
> tracks current dependency versions.
>
> This branch pins `requests` — and, on Python 3.9, `urllib3` — at their terminal
> 3.9-compatible releases. Those carry three unfixed CVEs (two HIGH) that `main` does not
> have, whose fixes require Python 3.10+ and so can never land on a 3.9 install. None is
> reachable through this CLI's code paths. Read the **Security** section of `README.md`
> before adopting this branch.
>
> This branch is tested on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12: CI runs the suite on all four
> interpreters and is green on all four. The CI matrix is the authority.

## Installation

### Option A: Install from source (development)

```bash
git clone --branch compat/python-3.9 <repo-url> elisity-cli
cd elisity-cli
pip install -e .
```

### Option B: Install from PyPI (when published)

```bash
pip install elisity-cli
```

### Option C: Clone and use a virtual environment

```bash
git clone <repo-url> elisity-cli
cd elisity-cli
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

### Verify the installation

```bash
elisity --version
```

Expected output:

```
elisity, version 0.1.0
```

All dependencies (click, requests, tenacity, rich, pyyaml, jmespath) are installed automatically.

## Configure Your First Profile

The CLI needs three things to connect to a CCC instance: the base URL, a client ID, and a client secret. You can provide these two ways.

### Method 1: Named profiles (recommended)

Named profiles are stored in `~/.elisity/config.yaml` and persist across sessions. Use this for interactive work and when you manage multiple CCC instances.

```bash
elisity config set-profile prod \
  --base-url https://prod-ccc.idp01.elisity.io \
  --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  --client-secret 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
```

Output:

```
Profile 'prod' saved to ~/.elisity/config.yaml
```

The first profile you create becomes the active profile automatically. To switch between profiles:

```bash
# Switch active profile
elisity config use-profile prod

# List all profiles
elisity config list-profiles

# Show active configuration (secrets redacted)
elisity config show
```

You can also select a profile per-command with the `-p` flag:

```bash
elisity -p staging topology get-all-sites
```

### Method 2: Environment variables (CI/scripting)

Environment variables override profile values. Useful in CI pipelines or one-off scripts.

```bash
export CCC_BASE_URL=https://your-ccc.idp01.elisity.io
export CCC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
export CCC_CLIENT_SECRET='your-client-secret'
```

Optional: `CCC_TIMEOUT` sets the request timeout in seconds (default: 30).

---

## Verify Authentication

Run the auth test to confirm the CLI can reach your CCC and authenticate:

```bash
elisity auth test
```

Expected output:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "code": 200,
  "authenticated": true
}
```

If authentication fails, verify:
- Your CCC instance is reachable (`curl -s https://your-ccc.idp01.elisity.io`)
- The client ID and secret are correct
- Your network allows outbound HTTPS to the CCC

Two additional auth commands are available:

```bash
# Decode your current JWT token claims (issuer, roles, expiry)
elisity auth whoami

# Print the raw bearer token (pipe into other tools or curl)
elisity auth token
```

---

## Run Your First Commands

### List all sites

```bash
elisity topology get-all-sites
```

### List virtual edges

```bash
elisity topology get-virtual-edge
```

### Get device count

```bash
elisity devices get-device-count
```

### List policy sets

```bash
elisity policy get-all-as-nd-json
```

### Get a specific site by ID

```bash
elisity topology get-site-v2 <site-id>
```

### Query devices with a request body

Commands that accept a request body use `--body` (inline JSON) or `--body-file` (path to a JSON file):

```bash
# Inline JSON — first 5 devices
elisity devices get-devices-view --body '{"pageable":{"page":0,"size":5}}'

# From a file
elisity devices get-devices-view --body-file request.json
```

### Destructive commands require confirmation

Delete operations require `--confirm`:

```bash
elisity topology delete-site-v2 <site-id> --confirm
```

---

## Output Formats

Every command supports four output formats via the `-f` flag:

| Flag | Format | Best for |
|------|--------|----------|
| `-f json` | Pretty-printed JSON (default) | Scripting, piping to `jq` |
| `-f table` | Rich terminal table | Interactive browsing |
| `-f yaml` | YAML | Human-readable config review |
| `-f csv` | CSV | Spreadsheet import, reporting |

### Examples

```bash
# Table view of all sites
elisity topology get-all-sites -f table

# YAML output
elisity topology get-all-sites -f yaml

# CSV for export
elisity topology get-all-sites -f csv > sites.csv
```

You can set a default format per profile:

```bash
elisity config set-profile prod \
  --base-url https://prod-ccc.idp01.elisity.io \
  --client-id YOUR_ID \
  --client-secret 'YOUR_SECRET' \
  --default-format table
```

---

## Filter Results with JMESPath

Use `-q` to apply a [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) expression to any command's output. This filters and reshapes the JSON response before rendering.

### Extract a single field from each item

```bash
# Site names only
elisity topology get-all-sites -q '[].name'
```

```json
[
  "headquarters",
  "branch-east",
  "branch-west"
]
```

### Count results

```bash
elisity topology get-all-sites -q 'length(@)'
```

```
3
```

### Filter by condition

```bash
# Sites where name contains "branch"
elisity topology get-all-sites -q "[?contains(name, 'branch')]"
```

### Select specific fields

```bash
# Name and ID only, as a table
elisity topology get-all-sites -q '[].{name: name, id: id}' -f table
```

### Combine with output format

JMESPath filtering applies before formatting, so you can query and then render:

```bash
elisity devices get-devices-view --body '{"pageable":{"page":0,"size":10}}' \
  -q 'content[].{ip: ipAddress, mac: macAddress, name: deviceName}' \
  -f table
```
