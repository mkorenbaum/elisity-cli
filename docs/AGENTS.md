# AI Agent Operating Guide for elisity-cli

This document is the operating contract for AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, copilots,
custom orchestrators) running `elisity-cli` on a human's behalf. It is *not* a
generic CLI tutorial — for that, read [user-guide.md](user-guide.md) first. This
guide assumes you already know how to authenticate and how to read JSON.

The job here is precise: when a human says "give me the Zero Trust score" or
"list our VENs in monitor mode", you (the agent) translate that to the *exact*
CLI command that runs against the live tenant — without guessing, without
inventing flags, and without paraphrasing UI terminology into the wrong API
verb.

The CLI ships with the answers. Use them.

---

## Core operating principle

**When a human term is ambiguous, ask the CLI before you ask the human.**

```bash
elisity glossary search "<phrase>"     # JSON — full mapping entry
elisity glossary explain "<phrase>"    # Prose — ready-to-paste commands
```

If `glossary explain` returns recipes, you have a verified mapping. Use it.
If it returns "no direct CLI surface for this term — terminology only",
clarify scope with the human before running anything API-side.

If `glossary search` errors with `No glossary term matched`, the phrase is
not a known synonym. Either pick a closer phrasing, or fall back to
`elisity <best-guess-group> --help` to inspect the surface — *then* report
to the human what you found, instead of running a destructive command on
a hunch.

## When humans say X, run Y

The 25 most common UI-term → CLI mappings. This is a flat lookup table for
copy-paste. For the long-form rationale, run `elisity glossary explain "<term>"`
or read [glossary.md](glossary.md).

| Human says | Canonical | Run |
|---|---|---|
| "monitor mode policies" / "simulation policies" | Simulation | `elisity reporting get-policy-count --monitor-mode MONITOR_ONLY` |
| "active policies" / "enforce mode" | Active | `elisity reporting get-policy-count --monitor-mode MONITOR_AND_ENFORCE` |
| "external monitoring" / "independent control" | Independent Control | `elisity reporting get-policy-count --monitor-mode MONITOR_EXTERNAL` |
| "list all policy groups" / "list segments" | Policy Group | `elisity policy get-policy-groups-json` |
| "show me policy group X" | Policy Group | `elisity policy get-policy-group-by-id <PG_ID>` |
| "what devices are in PG X" | Policy Group | `elisity policy get-policy-group-devices <PG_ID>` |
| "list ACLs" / "list firewall rules" | Security Profile | `elisity policy get-all-security-profiles-as-nd-json` |
| "show the policy matrix" | Policy Matrix | `elisity policy get-matrix` |
| "Zero Trust score" / "posture score" / "compliance score" | Policy Enforcement Score | `elisity reporting get-aggregate-enforcement-score` |
| "Zero Trust score for site X" | Policy Enforcement Score | `elisity reporting get-site-kpis --site <SITE>` (CCC 26.7 removed the per-policy-set score) |
| "per-PG Zero Trust breakdown" | Policy Enforcement Score | `elisity reporting get-zero-trust-metrics` |
| "why is the score low" / "what should I fix to improve the score" | Policy Enforcement Score | `elisity -f table reporting diagnose-low-score` |
| "list our VENs" / "list switches" | Virtual Edge Node | `elisity topology get-virtual-edge-nodes` |
| "VEN inventory by model" | Virtual Edge Node | `elisity reporting get-virtual-edge-nodes-count` |
| "list Virtual Edges" | Virtual Edge | `elisity reporting get-virtual-edges-count` |
| "list distribution zones" / "list VLAN zones" | Distribution Zone | `elisity topology get-all-distribution-zones` |
| "list sites" | (Site — not glossary) | `elisity topology get-all-sites` |
| "per-site KPIs" / "site dashboard" | Policy Enforcement Score | `elisity -f table reporting get-site-kpis` |
| "device inventory" / "show the CMDB" | IdentityGraph | `elisity devices get-devices-view --body '{"pageable":{"page":0,"size":50}}'` |
| "online device count" | IdentityGraph | `elisity reporting get-device-count --online true` |
| "devices by connector" | IdentityGraph | `elisity reporting get-devices-by-connector` |
| "list Insights suggestions" / "AI recommendations" | Insights | `elisity insights get-suggestions` |
| "pending adjudications" / "things to approve" | Adjudication | `elisity insights get-suggestions -q '[?status==`PENDING`]'` |
| "top talkers" / "traffic analytics dashboard" | Traffic Analytics | `elisity flows get-dash-board-summary-data` |
| "top denied IPs" | Traffic Analytics | `elisity reporting get-top-ips-by-traffic --kind DENIED --top 10` |
| "what's in the Unassigned PG" | Unassigned (Policy Group) | `elisity policy get-policy-groups-json -q '[?name==\`Unassigned\`]'` then `get-policy-group-devices <ID>` |

If a row in the table above resolves to a destructive or state-changing operation,
**do not run it without explicit human approval** — see [Destructive operations](#destructive-operations) below.

## Using `elisity glossary` for runtime lookup

The `glossary` group is your disambiguation surface. Three subcommands, all
read-only, all data-local (no API call needed).

### `elisity glossary list`

Returns the 19 canonical terms with their domain and (where applicable) enum
value. Use this to confirm a domain mapping when you're unsure which API group
backs a UI feature.

```bash
elisity glossary list
elisity -f table glossary list           # human-readable table
elisity glossary list -q "[?domain==\`policy\`]"   # just policy-domain terms
```

### `elisity glossary search "<phrase>"`

Looks up the full mapping entry for any synonym. Output is JSON by default —
easy to feed back into your own prompt context.

```bash
elisity glossary search "monitor mode"
elisity glossary search "Zero Trust score"
elisity glossary search VEN
elisity glossary search "audit mode"     # also resolves to Simulation
```

If no synonym matches, the command exits with status 1 and writes the failure
to stderr. Trap the exit code in agentic shells:

```bash
if ! elisity glossary search "$phrase" > /tmp/match.json 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "Unknown term — falling back to <group> --help" >&2
fi
```

### `elisity glossary explain "<phrase>"`

This is the agent-optimised path. Plain text output, no JSON parsing required,
includes inline command recipes ready to copy:

```bash
$ elisity glossary explain "Zero Trust score"
Term: Policy Enforcement Score
Domain: reporting
Also called: security score, risk score, ...

Context:
  0-100 metric for policy coverage quality. ...

CLI recipes:

  # Get the tenant-wide Zero Trust / Policy Enforcement Score headline number
  elisity reporting get-aggregate-enforcement-score
  # Returns the single FloatMetricValue the CCC dashboard tile shows. ...
```

Use `explain` when you need to *report back* to the human ("the CLI command for
that is …"), and `search` when you need structured data to act on.

---

## Default workflow for unknown terms

When a human asks for something using a phrase you don't immediately recognise:

1. **Try `elisity glossary search "<phrase>"`.** If a match returns, the
   mapping entry tells you the canonical term, the domain, and at least one
   verified CLI command. Run that command.

2. **If no glossary match**, ask `elisity <best-guess-group> --help` to list
   commands in the most likely group. Match by name; do not invent commands.

3. **If still ambiguous**, return to the human with the candidate canonical
   terms you considered, the command you intend to run, and a yes/no question.
   Do not act on a guess for non-trivial operations.

4. **Never paraphrase a UI feature into a plausible-but-fake CLI command.**
   The CLI has 613 commands; if a verb you imagine isn't in `--help`, it
   doesn't exist. The honesty rule is non-negotiable — fabricated commands
   waste human review cycles and damage trust.

## Diagnosing a low/zero Zero Trust score (do not guess the cause)

This is the single most common reasoning error agents make on this CLI, so it
gets its own section. When a human asks "which devices have the worst Zero Trust
score and what should I fix?", the trap is to read a 0% score off
`get-zero-trust-metrics` and conclude "the policies are in simulation —
activate them." **A 0% coverage score does not tell you the cause.** It has
three distinct root causes with *opposite* fixes:

| Cause | What you'd see | Correct fix |
|---|---|---|
| **No policy** | the group has no policy at all | *create* a policy / check Insights suggestions / reclassify the devices — there is nothing to activate |
| **Simulation only** | policies exist, all `MONITOR_ONLY` | activate them via `policy change-status` |
| **Active but uncovered** | policies are already `MONITOR_AND_ENFORCE`, score still low | the group's real traffic isn't covered — reclassify catch-all devices / add rules for the uncovered flows |

Recommending `policy change-status` for a *no-policy* group, or for a group
whose policies are *already active*, is a fabricated remediation — it names a
fix that does nothing. That violates the honesty rule.

**Do not infer the cause from the score. Run the command that joins the score
with the actual policy status:**

```bash
# One call: every low-scoring group, classified, with a per-row remediation.
elisity -f table reporting diagnose-low-score

# Worst-first, full detail (includes the `remediation` field to relay verbatim)
elisity reporting diagnose-low-score --threshold 100

# Scope to a site, e.g. the one the human named
elisity reporting diagnose-low-score --site Hospital
```

Each row carries a `diagnosis` (`NO_POLICY`, `SIMULATION_ONLY`, `EXTERNAL_ONLY`,
`MIXED_LOW_COVERAGE`, `ACTIVE_LOW_COVERAGE`) and a `remediation` string. Relay
the remediation; do not substitute your own assumption. Only after
`diagnose-low-score` says `SIMULATION_ONLY` (or `MIXED_LOW_COVERAGE`) should you
propose `policy change-status` — and `change-status` is a state-changing verb,
so it still needs explicit human approval (see
[Destructive operations](#destructive-operations)).

## Common pitfalls

These bite new users and agents both. Skim this section once; the failure
modes are non-obvious.

### Pagination wrapper

POST search endpoints require the pageable wrapper. A flat body is silently ignored:

```bash
# WRONG — silently returns the unpaginated default
elisity devices get-devices-view --body '{"page":0,"size":10}'

# RIGHT — body is wrapped in `pageable`
elisity devices get-devices-view --body '{"pageable":{"page":0,"size":10}}'
```

GET search endpoints (e.g. `ad get-entra-users`) use `--page` and `--size` flags
directly. See [user-guide.md](user-guide.md) for the full breakdown.

### `--body` not `--data`

The flag for JSON request bodies is `--body` (or `--body-file <path>`). Older
help text shows `--data` — that's stale; the CLI rejects it.

### `--confirm` required for DELETE

Every delete and bulk-delete command requires `--confirm` on the command line.
Without it, the CLI refuses to send the request. Do not work around this — it
is intentional friction.

### Global flags go BEFORE the group

`-f`, `-q`, `--debug`, and `-p` are options on the root `cli` group. They must
appear *before* the subcommand group name:

```bash
# WRONG — `-f` is not a flag on the `topology` group
elisity topology get-all-sites -f table

# RIGHT
elisity -f table topology get-all-sites
elisity -q '[].label' topology get-all-sites
```

This is a Click quirk; agents reading the help output should learn it once.

### `label` vs `name` on sites

The v1 sites endpoint exposes `label`, not `name`. JMESPath like `[].name`
returns an empty list — use `[].label`:

```bash
elisity topology get-all-sites -q '[].label'
```

### Snapshot times for reporting

GraphQL reporting queries operate on top-of-hour UTC snapshots. Not every hour
has data. Default is the previous full hour. Use `elisity reporting list-snapshots`
to find available snapshots before passing a custom `--snapshot`.

### Stream endpoints are ndjson, not JSON arrays

`elisity policy get-all-as-nd-json` and friends stream newline-delimited JSON.
The CLI parses them transparently into a JSON array on output — `-q '[?…]'` works.
Do not pipe the raw bytes into `jq` expecting a JSON document; pipe the CLI's
parsed output, or use the CLI's own `-q` filter.

## Destructive operations

The following verbs change live tenant state. Treat each as a P0 confirmation
gate: report the exact command to the human, get explicit go/no-go, then run.

- `delete-*`, `bulk-*` (create/delete/move/update), `decommission-*`,
  `force-delete-*` (deletes always require `--confirm`)
- `create-*`, `update-*`, `patch-*`, `replace-*`, `overwrite-*`, `rename-*`
- `add-*`, `remove-*`, `move-*`, `reorder-*` — including
  `add-definition` / `remove-definition` on custom applications, and
  `move-policy-group-scope`
- `change-status`, `change-active-ve`, `change-ven-group`
- `enable-*` / `disable-*` — policy groups, and VE/VEN **maintenance mode**
  (`enable-maintenance`, `enable-maintenance-for-group`, and their `disable-`
  counterparts) — maintenance mode changes enforcement behaviour on live
  infrastructure
- `set-*` — `set-feature-flag-ig`, `set-logger-levels-bulk`,
  `set-distribution-zones`
- `activate-workflow`, `recreate-policy-suggestions`,
  `reset-suggestions-to-default`
- `import-*` / `cancel-import`, `upload-*` (bulk VE/VEN JSON, AD agent logs)
- `sync-*`, `refresh-*`, `force-sync`, `resync`, `re-initialize-*`,
  `discover-ec2workloads` — these trigger real work against live infrastructure
  even though they create nothing directly
- `restart` (restarts an AD connector), `pull-logs`, `save-activity-logs`
- `pause-snapshot-schedule`, `resume-snapshot-schedule`
- `generate-external-id` — mints and persists an AWS external ID / account ID

A safe rule of thumb: if a command in the glossary mapping starts with anything
other than `get-`, `list-`, `read-`, `search-`, `count-`, or `export-`, get
human approval before running.

### POST commands that are read-only

The rule of thumb above is deliberately strict, and it will flag a handful of
commands that only read. CCC uses `POST` for queries whose filter payload is too
large for a query string, so the HTTP verb is not a reliable signal on its own.
These are safe to run without approval — each is described as a read in the CCC
spec:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `devices devices-view` | Query devices with CSearch filters |
| `devices devices-aggregate` | Get device aggregate counts |
| `devices get-devices-view` | Paginated device listing |
| `policy lookup` | Resolve a batch of label IDs to metadata |
| `policy preview-operation` | Preview the scope of a matrix operation — explicitly a dry run |
| `policy validate-*`, `connectors validate-*` | Validate a payload without applying it |
| `flows traffic-record-export` | Export traffic records as CSV |
| `devices generate-trust-policy` | Render the IAM trust-policy JSON for the operator to apply in AWS |

Anything not in this table gets the rule of thumb. When a new command appears
and you cannot tell, treat it as destructive and ask.

## Worked examples

Two end-to-end agent workflows that exercise the patterns above.

### Example 1 — "What's our Zero Trust score and which policy sets are dragging it down?"

```bash
# 1. Disambiguate (agent reflex — always start here)
elisity glossary explain "Zero Trust score"
#   → Term: Policy Enforcement Score
#   → Recipe: elisity reporting get-aggregate-enforcement-score
#   → Recipe: elisity reporting get-site-kpis --site <SITE>

# 2. Headline number
elisity reporting get-aggregate-enforcement-score
#   → [{"value": 73.4, ...}]

# 3. Per-site breakdown. CCC 26.7 removed the per-policy-set GraphQL field
#    (policyMetrics.policySetEnforcementScore), so per-site is the narrowest
#    enforcement score available; go to policy-group granularity in step 4.
elisity -f table reporting get-site-kpis \
  -q '[].{site: siteName, score: policyEnforcementScore}'
#   → lowest scores are the drag.

# 4. WHY they drag — per-group cause + fix. Don't infer "simulation" from a low
#    score; this joins the score with each group's real policy status.
elisity -f table reporting diagnose-low-score --threshold 100
#   → NO_POLICY / SIMULATION_ONLY / ACTIVE_LOW_COVERAGE per group, with a
#     remediation string. Relay that — see "Diagnosing a low/zero Zero Trust score".
```

### Example 2 — "List our switches in visibility-only mode at the Boston site."

```bash
# 1. Disambiguate
elisity glossary explain "visibility ven"
#   → Term: Visibility-Only Virtual Edge Node
#   → Recipe: elisity topology get-virtual-edge-nodes (inspect mode field)

# 2. Pull all VENs at the site (sites are referenced by label)
elisity topology get-virtual-edge-nodes -q "content[?siteName==\`Boston\`]"

# 3. Filter to visibility-only mode
#    Per-tenant mode-field naming varies; first inspect a sample row:
elisity topology get-virtual-edge-nodes -q "content[0]"
#    Then once you know the field (e.g. `deploymentMode`):
elisity topology get-virtual-edge-nodes -q "content[?deploymentMode==\`VISIBILITY_ONLY\` && siteName==\`Boston\`]"
```

The honesty rule applies inside the filter, too — if the deployment-mode field
name on this tenant differs, report what you see in `content[0]` and ask the
human to confirm the field name rather than fabricating one.

---

## Where the mapping data lives

The mapping is loaded from `data/ui-to-cli-mapping.json` (canonical, repo
root) and is also packaged inside the installed wheel at
`src/elisity_cli/data/ui-to-cli-mapping.json`. Updates flow upstream from
`Elisity/ccc` (`product-glossary.json`) — see `data/product-glossary.json`'s
`_source` block for the original location and import metadata.

If you find a glossary term that's missing a real CLI command, *do not*
invent one. Open a ticket against `mkorenbaum/elisity-cli` to add the
recipe. The honesty rule (recipe → real command or empty) is enforced by
the test `tests/test_glossary.py`.
