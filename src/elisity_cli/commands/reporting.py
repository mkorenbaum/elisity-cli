"""Reporting / GraphQL — Zero Trust scores, threat vectors, risk attribution.

The CCC reporting API at ``POST /api/reporting/v1/data`` is a GraphQL endpoint.
It is **not** in the OpenAPI spec — so unlike the other command groups, these
commands are hand-coded rather than generated. They wrap the GraphQL queries
the CCC dashboard UI uses for:

- Zero Trust page — per-policy-group device & policy coverage scores, restricted
  vs total flows, L4 port exposure, MITRE-style threat vectors.
- Malware lateral movement page — same threat vector data viewed by technique.
- Per-device risk attribution — Zero Trust metrics with the device MAC included.

Snapshots are taken at top-of-hour UTC; not every hour has data. Use
``elisity reporting list-snapshots`` to find available snapshot times.

    A Zero Trust coverage score of 0 is ambiguous on its own. This command
    joins the coverage metric (`get-zero-trust-metrics`) with the actual policy
    status of each group (from the policy stream) and assigns one of:

    \b
      NO_POLICY           no policy references the group at all -> create one
      SIMULATION_ONLY     all policies are MONITOR_ONLY          -> activate them
      EXTERNAL_ONLY       all policies are MONITOR_EXTERNAL       -> by design
      MIXED_LOW_COVERAGE  active + simulation, still low coverage -> verify flows
      ACTIVE_LOW_COVERAGE policies already active, still low      -> reclassify devices

    Each row carries a `remediation` string. This is what stops an agent from
    recommending "activate the simulation policies" for a group that has no
    policy (nothing to activate) or whose policies are already active.

    Heuristic + limitation: a group is matched to a policy when it appears as
    the source OR destination of a non-disabled policy. System groups shared
    across sites (e.g. Unassigned) match policies authored at other sites, so
    their policy counts are tenant-wide, not site-scoped — the diagnosis label
    is still correct, but treat the raw counts as an upper bound.
