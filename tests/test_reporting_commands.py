"""
Behavioural tests for the hand-coded `reporting` commands.

`tests/test_reporting_graphql_schema.py` proves the queries agree with the CCC
26.7 schema. These tests prove the commands still *behave* correctly around
them: what goes on the wire, and what comes back out.

Two things are load-bearing here:

1. **The 26.7 filter move.** The per-device selectors now travel inside the
   `ZeroTrustFilters` input object. A test that only checks the query string
   would not notice the CLI silently dropping the selector it was asked for, so
   the request body itself is asserted.

2. **The 26.7 coverage reshape.** `avgDeviceCoverage` / `avgPolicyCoverage` were
   deleted from `ZeroTrustMetrics`; the numbers now arrive nested under
   `policyDeploymentMetrics`. The response fixtures below are shaped the new way,
   and the command must pass the nested object through rather than flatten it
   back onto the row under the old names — flattening would assert an
   equivalence nobody has established against a live tenant.

The GraphQL responses below are shaped as the live 26.7 endpoint returns them
(`data.policyMetrics.zeroTrustMetrics[]`). No live tenant is contacted.
