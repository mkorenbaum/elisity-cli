"""Render a command-level changelog from a spec_diff.py --json report.

Mike's requirement for the 26.7 bump was that the README say *what commands
were added or changed*, not just carry refreshed totals. A hand-maintained list
of 192 additions drifts the moment anyone regenerates, so this renders it from
the diff instead: `spec_diff.py --json` is the input, markdown is the output,
and the next CCC bump is the same one command.

    python3 tools/spec_diff.py old.json new.json --json > diff.json
    python3 tools/gen_changelog.py --diff diff.json --version 26.7 \
        --source insights-demo.idp01.elisity.io > changelog.md

Changes are split by whether they can break a caller, which is the distinction
a reader actually needs:

* **Signature** changes alter the command's flags — a script can stop working.
* **Request body** changes alter the JSON passed to `--body`/`--body-file`.
  The generator emits the body as one opaque JSON option rather than per-field
  flags, so these never change the command's signature, but they do change what
  a caller must send.
* **Response-only** changes cannot break an invocation at all, so they are
  counted rather than enumerated.

Reconciliation
--------------
`spec_diff.py` keys operations by `(METHOD, path)`, so a surviving operation
whose PATH was renamed shows up as one removal plus one addition — while the
command name, derived from the operationId, never changed. Rendered naively that
produces a "Removed (breaking)" section listing commands that still exist, an
"Added" section listing the same commands, and — worst of the three — it hides a
genuine break: `/devices/attributes/trustAttributes/values` became
`/devices/attributes/{attributeName}/values`, which made a positional argument
MANDATORY. A reader looking for migration guidance finds the command under
"Removed" and gets none.

So the diff is reconciled by `(group, command)` before anything is rendered: an
entry appearing on both sides is a path/operation move, is dropped from both
lists, and is emitted under "Changed command signatures" with its real delta.

A third shape needs its own section. `/api/policy/v1/state` really was deleted
from the spec — but `/api/state-sync/v1/state` survived and, with the name it
was competing with now free, took over `policy get-state`. So the command name
still resolves and quietly calls a **different endpoint**. "Any script invoking
one will now fail with `No such command`" is not merely wrong there; it is
backwards. Nothing fails, and that is the problem.

Flags, not spec names
---------------------
A parameter's CLI flag is not always `--<spec name>`: the generator renames it
when it would collide with a flag the command already owns, and a path parameter
is a positional argument with no flag at all. This module resolves the emitted
name through the generator's own `resolve_parameter_names()`. Rendering the raw
spec name advertised `--format` on `devices export-devices`, where `--format` is
the CLI's own output-format override — `--format csv` was silently absorbed and
never sent, at exit 0. The flag that works is `--format-param`.
