# Elisity CCC CLI

[![tests](https://github.com/mkorenbaum/elisity-cli/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mkorenbaum/elisity-cli/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Command-line interface to the Elisity Cloud Control Center (CCC) API. Provides complete coverage of the CCC API surface — all 583 REST endpoints from the OpenAPI spec, plus 17 hand-coded GraphQL commands for the `/api/reporting/v1/data` endpoint (Zero Trust scores, threat vectors, per-site KPIs, traffic vectors) that the OpenAPI spec doesn't include, plus a 3-command CLI-native `glossary` group that maps Elisity UI terminology to CLI commands.

Generated from the **CCC 26.7** OpenAPI spec. See [What changed in CCC 26.7](#what-changed-in-ccc-267) for the command-level delta.

> **For AI agents:** see [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for a UI-term → CLI-command operating guide. The `elisity glossary` group is the runtime lookup surface.

## Features

- **610 commands** total (583 auto-generated from the CCC OpenAPI spec + 17 hand-coded GraphQL reporting commands + 7 CLI-native auth/config + 3 CLI-native glossary commands)
- **Multi-profile configuration** — manage multiple CCC environments (prod, staging, lab)
- **4 output formats** — JSON (default), table, YAML, CSV
- **JMESPath filtering** — reshape and filter output with `-q` expressions
- **OAuth2 authentication** — client_credentials grant with auto-refresh
- **NDJSON support** — transparent parsing of newline-delimited JSON endpoints
- **GraphQL reporting** — `reporting` group wraps the CCC dashboard's GraphQL queries (Zero Trust scores, site KPIs, threat vectors, traffic-by-PG/IP)
- **UI-term glossary** — `glossary` group answers "what command runs the Zero Trust Score tile?" without guesswork
- **Destructive-op safety** — `--confirm` required for all 67 destructive commands, classified by API path rather than HTTP verb (every DELETE, plus POST bulk deletes, PUT decommission, Insights reset/recreate)
- **Retry with backoff** — automatic retry on connection errors and timeouts

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/mkorenbaum/elisity-cli.git
cd elisity-cli

# Install (use a venv — modern Ubuntu/Debian block system-wide pip per PEP 668)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# Configure
elisity config set-profile myenv \
  --base-url https://your-ccc.idp01.elisity.io \
  --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  --client-secret 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'

# Verify
elisity auth test

# What command runs the "Zero Trust Score" tile in the UI?
elisity glossary explain "Zero Trust score"
```

**Or use environment variables:**

```bash
export CCC_BASE_URL=https://your-ccc.idp01.elisity.io
export CCC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
export CCC_CLIENT_SECRET='your-client-secret'
elisity auth test
```

> **For agents and humans new to Elisity:** read **[docs/user-guide.md](docs/user-guide.md)** before doing real work. It is the workflow-oriented guide and has worked examples for the most common queries (devices per site, VEN inventory, posture score, flow search, scripting). The README below is reference material; the user guide is the tutorial. AI agents should additionally read [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md).

## Usage

```bash
# List sites
elisity topology get-all-sites

# List sites as a table
elisity -f table topology get-all-sites

# Extract just site names
elisity topology get-all-sites -q '[].name'

# View devices (paginated — note nested 'pageable' wrapper)
elisity devices get-devices-view --body '{"pageable":{"page":0,"size":10}}'

# List policy sets
elisity policy get-all-as-nd-json

# Get a specific site by ID
elisity topology get-site-v2 <SITE_ID>

# Delete a site (requires confirmation)
elisity topology delete-site-v2 <SITE_ID> --confirm

# Tenant Zero Trust score (GraphQL reporting endpoint, not in OpenAPI spec)
elisity reporting get-aggregate-enforcement-score

# Per-site KPI dashboard (devices, VENs, policy counts, enforcement score)
elisity -f table reporting get-site-kpis

# Map UI term → CLI command
elisity glossary search "monitor mode"
elisity glossary explain "VEN"

# Get bearer token for use in scripts
TOKEN=$(elisity auth token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://your-ccc.idp01.elisity.io/api/topology/v2/sites
```

### Regenerating commands from a new CCC OpenAPI spec

The API-backed groups are generated from the CCC OpenAPI specification, pulled from a
live tenant at `GET /v3/api-docs` (served unauthenticated). The current command set was
generated from the **CCC 26.7** spec — OpenAPI 3.1.0, 441 paths / 583 operations —
captured from `insights-demo.idp01.elisity.io` on 2026-08-05. The previous set came from
the CCC 26.3-era spec (OpenAPI 3.0.1, 329 paths / 436 operations, captured 2026-06-21).

> **The spec carries no CCC version stamp.** `info.version` reads `1.0.0` in both 26.3
> and 26.7 — that is the gateway API version and it does not track the CCC release. The
> CCC version above is cited from the tenant the spec was pulled from, so record that
> provenance whenever you refresh the baseline.

**Always diff before you regenerate.** The diff is what makes a version bump reviewable:

```bash
# 1. What changed between the two specs?
python3 tools/spec_diff.py old-api-docs.json new-api-docs.json

# Machine-readable form, and a mode that fails when a new tag has no group mapping
python3 tools/spec_diff.py old-api-docs.json new-api-docs.json --json > diff.json
python3 tools/spec_diff.py old-api-docs.json new-api-docs.json --strict
```

`spec_diff.py` reports added, removed and changed operations — including parameter
type/required changes, request-body and response schema changes (resolved through
`$ref`, so a change *inside* a referenced schema is visible), and the CLI command each
operation becomes. New tags with no `TAG_TO_GROUP` entry are surfaced separately: they
fall back to a path-prefix guess and need an explicit mapping decision.

```bash
# 2. Map any new tags in TAG_TO_GROUP (generate_commands.py), then regenerate.
python3 generate_commands.py --spec new-api-docs.json

# The spec path resolves as: --spec > $ELISITY_API_SPEC > the historical host path
ELISITY_API_SPEC=new-api-docs.json python3 generate_commands.py

# 3. Regenerate the changelog section of this README from the same diff.
python3 tools/gen_changelog.py --diff diff.json --version 26.8 \
    --source your-tenant.idp01.elisity.io --baseline 26.7

# 4. Confirm counts, the delete gate, and the docs all still agree.
python3 tools/audit_counts.py
pytest
```

**The generator refuses to run if any spec tag has no `TAG_TO_GROUP` entry**, printing
each unmapped tag, its operation count, and the group the path-prefix fallback would
otherwise have picked. This is deliberate: an unmapped tag is not a loud failure, it is
a silent misrouting. CCC 26.7 renamed 16 tags, and six `Connectors Configurations`
operations moved from `connectors` to `devices` that way while the totals stayed
entirely plausible. Map the tag, then regenerate.

The changelog is generated from the diff rather than hand-written, because a
hand-maintained list of ~200 command changes drifts the first time anyone regenerates.

`audit_counts.py` walks the source tree and emits the authoritative numbers — total,
per group, generated vs hand-coded, delete commands and `--confirm` coverage. It exits
non-zero when `README.md` or `docs/command-reference.md` disagree with the source, so
documentation drift fails CI instead of accumulating. It is also enforced from the test
suite (`tests/test_command_invariants.py`).

Two invariants are enforced mechanically because a bulk regeneration is too large to
review by eye:

- **Confirm gate** — every DESTRUCTIVE command requires `--confirm`, not merely every
  DELETE. The denominator is derived from the API path (`is_destructive_operation()` in
  `generate_commands.py`, the single definition in the project) and re-derived from the
  shipped source by the audit, so the gate and the metric cannot measure different sets.
  Coverage is asserted at 100% over 67 commands; a regression names the offending
  commands. A command whose *name* reads destructive while its path does not classify is
  also a failure until a human rules on it in `NON_DESTRUCTIVE_DESPITE_NAME` — three
  entries today, all dry-run or resync operations.
- **Hand-coded survival** — the `reporting` (GraphQL) and `glossary` (CLI-native) groups
  are not in the OpenAPI spec. Regeneration never rewrites their modules and always
  keeps them registered in `COMMAND_GROUPS`; the generator aborts if a spec tag is ever
  mapped onto one of them.

## What changed in CCC 26.7

The command set is generated from the CCC 26.7 OpenAPI spec, pulled from `insights-demo.idp01.elisity.io`. The previous set came from the 26.3 spec.

| | 26.3 | 26.7 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Spec paths | 329 | 441 |
| Spec operations | 436 | 583 |

**190 commands added, 42 removed, 276 operations changed, 1 command name(s) repointed at a different endpoint.**

### GraphQL `reporting` changes (breaking)

The `reporting` group is hand-coded against the CCC GraphQL endpoint
(`/api/reporting/v1/data`), which is not in the OpenAPI spec — so it is **not**
regenerated by a spec bump. CCC 26.7 changed that GraphQL schema underneath it,
which no static check in this repo could see: the suite passed, the spec diff was
clean, and the commands below failed only when executed against a live 26.7
tenant. `tools/gql_schema_check.py` + `tests/test_reporting_graphql_schema.py`
now validate every reporting query against a staged introspection of the live
schema, so the next drift fails the suite instead of shipping.

- **`get-zero-trust-metrics` — fixed, twice.** Two separate 26.7 changes broke
  this query, one layer apart.

  *Arguments.* The per-device selectors moved out of `zeroTrustMetrics`'s
  top-level arguments into a `ZeroTrustFilters` input object; passing
  `macAddress` at the top level is rejected with
  `Validation error (UnknownArgument@[policyMetrics/zeroTrustMetrics])`. The
  argument now travels in `filters`, and a new repeatable `--mac-address`
  option exposes it (it implies `--include-mac`). `list-snapshots` shares this
  query and is fixed by the same change.

  *Selection set.* `avgDeviceCoverage` and `avgPolicyCoverage` no longer exist
  on `ZeroTrustMetrics`
  (`FieldUndefined@[policyMetrics/zeroTrustMetrics/avgDeviceCoverage]`). This is
  a **reshape, not a rename**: the coverage numbers now live inside a nested
  `policyDeploymentMetrics` object. The command selects `deviceCoverage` and
  `policyDeviceCoverage` from it and returns the object **as the server shapes
  it** — deliberately not flattened back onto the row under the old names,
  because nothing in 26.7 states the new fields are the same measurement on the
  same 0–100 scale. **Any script reading `.avgDeviceCoverage` must be repointed
  at `.policyDeploymentMetrics.deviceCoverage`, and any threshold written for
  the old scale must be re-checked against real output.**

  The other four `policyDeploymentMetrics` fields (`policyWorkloadCoverage`,
  `workloadCoverage`, `devicePolicyCounts`, `workloadPolicyCounts`) are not
  selected: the introspection available carried field names but not type kinds,
  and selecting an object field without a sub-selection fails validation for the
  whole query.

- **`diagnose-low-score` — REMOVED.** It filtered on
  `avgDeviceCoverage < threshold OR avgPolicyCoverage < threshold`, and both
  fields are gone. It was not re-pointed at the nested replacements because two
  things about them cannot be established without a live tenant: their **units**
  (`--threshold` is documented and defaulted as a percentage — a 0.0–1.0
  fraction would flag every group in the tenant) and the **row grain** to
  aggregate over. Since the command existed precisely to stop an agent
  recommending `policy change-status` for a group that has no policy, a
  mis-scaled version would produce exactly the failure it was built to prevent.
  Same rule as the two removals below. The manual equivalent — take a low row's
  `policyGroupId`, then read the `monitorMode` of the policies referencing it
  via `policy get-all-policies-as-nd-json` — is documented in
  [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md#diagnosing-a-lowzero-zero-trust-score-do-not-guess-the-cause)
  and in `get-zero-trust-metrics --help`.
- **`get-policy-count-needed` — REMOVED.** `policyMetrics.countNeeded` no longer
  exists in 26.7 (`FieldUndefined`). It was not rewritten onto `coverage`:
  coverage answers "how covered are the policy groups I have", not "how many
  more policies are needed", and a plausible-but-wrong number is worse than an
  absent command. Any script invoking it now fails with `No such command`.
- **`get-policy-set-enforcement-score` — REMOVED.**
  `policyMetrics.policySetEnforcementScore` no longer exists in 26.7
  (`FieldUndefined`). No 26.7 field answers "enforcement score for one policy
  set". Closest surviving surfaces: `get-aggregate-enforcement-score`
  (tenant-wide), `get-site-kpis` (`policyEnforcementScore` per site), and
  `get-zero-trust-metrics` (per policy group). Confirmed against live 26.7
  introspection: `PolicyMetrics` carries exactly `count`, `coverage`,
  `aggregatePolicyEnforcementScore`, `policyGroups`, `zeroTrustMetrics` — there
  is no `policySetEnforcementScore` on it.

The `reporting` group is therefore **17 commands**, down from 20.

`tools/gql_schema_check.py` was extended in the same round: it now validates
**selection sets and nested fields**, not just arguments, and resolves named and
inline fragments against their type condition. The first version passed the
query the server rejected — `zeroTrustMetrics`'s arguments were correct, and the
fields underneath it were filed as "unverified" because `ZeroTrustMetrics` had
never been staged. It now reports coverage over **field paths** rather than
queries, and fails outright if staging for a type a shipped query selects on
goes missing, so the denominator cannot quietly shrink again.

### Removed commands (breaking)

These 42 commands are gone because the operation was removed from the CCC spec. Any script invoking one will now fail with `No such command`. Commands whose underlying *path* moved are not listed here — they still exist, and are under [Changed command signatures](#changed-command-signatures).

### Command names now pointing at a different endpoint (breaking, silent)

1 command name(s) survived the bump while the operation behind them did not. The old operation was deleted from the spec and a different surviving operation inherited the name, so **an existing script does not fail — it calls a different endpoint.** These are worth checking before anything else in this changelog.

- `elisity policy get-state` — was `GET /api/policy/v1/state` (deleted from the spec), now `GET /api/state-sync/v1/state`
  - the surviving operation also changed: renamed from `get-state-get`
